### James Hooper / @jamesdesigns

Hi, I'm James. I have been working as a Junior Web Developer the past year. My education began with a Bachelors of Fine Art degree as a Graphic Designer, and over the past year or so, I now hold a Bachelors degree in Web Design and Development. Two degrees, and one passion for the all things web related. My goal as a Web Developer and Designer, is to create well designed websites that are highly functional, unique, and useful.
