Hi, I'm James. I have been working as a Junior Web Developer the past year that primarily works with HTML5, JS, CSS3, and REACT. My career began as a Graphic Designer, where I received my Bachelors of Fine Art degree from the University of Utah. Over the past year I earned a Bachelors of Science degree in Web Design and Development from Utah Valley University. Two degrees, and one passion for all things web related. My goal as a Web Developer and Designer, is to create well designed websites that are highly functional, unique, and useful.
