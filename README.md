Hello. I primarily work with HTML5, CSS3, JS and REACT. I began my career and education as a Graphic Designer, where I earned a BFA degree from the University of Utah. Over the last year I earned a Bachelors of Science degree in Web Design and Development from Utah Valley University. Two degrees, and one passion for all things web related. My goal as a Web Developer and Designer, is to create well designed websites that are highly functional, unique, and useful.
